# Current Task Status

## Current Objectives
1. Set up initial FLTK window implementation
2. Test build with MinGW-w64
3. Verify basic window functionality

## Context
Basic application structure has been recreated with:
- Fresh src/ directory structure
- Initial MainWindow implementation
- Basic CMake configuration
- FLTK integration setup

## Next Steps
1. Install MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-fltk make
   ```
3. Add to PATH: C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles"
   cmake --build build --config Release
   ```
5. Test window creation with build/mdv.exe
