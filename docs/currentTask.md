# Current Task Status

## Current Objectives
1. Initial project setup and documentation
2. Prepare development environment for cross-platform C++ development

## Context
Starting from scratch with the following requirements:
- FLTK for GUI
- libcurl for downloads
- Markdown rendering library (cmark-gfm preferred)
- PDF generation library
- Compression library for font management

## Next Steps
1. Create techStack.md to document technology choices
2. Create codebaseSummary.md for project structure
3. Set up CMake build system
4. Configure initial FLTK window
